# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### Overview of Project

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings

#### Deliverable Requirements:
Using R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

The statistical study design has the following:

A metric to be tested is mentioned
A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described
A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis
This study would involve collecting data on MechaCar and its comparable models across several different manufacturers over the last 3 years.


Collecting data for comparable models across all major manufacturers for past 3 years for the following metrics:

Safety Feature Rating: Independent Variable
Current Price (Selling): Dependent Variable
Drive Package : Independent Variable
Engine (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline / Conventional): Independent Variable
Resale Value: Independent Variable
Average Annual Cost of ownership (Maintenance): Independent Variable
MPG (Gasoline Efficiency): Independent Variable
Hypothesis: Null and Alternative
After determining which factors are key for the MechaCar's genre:
